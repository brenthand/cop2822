				<p>"We wanted to make our land into a place that drew us in, a place we wanted to go back to again and again," says Lila Hodgkins. She and her husband Dave settled on a brook as the centerpoint of their project after a visit to some friends. "We sat in wooden chairs sipping lemonade on a warm summer day next to this babbling creek -- but we were in the middle of a big city! Papillion isn't as dense or as loud, but we still wanted that kind of escape."</p>
				<p>They spent three years planning, implementing, and fine-tuning their transformation on their 3.5 acre lot. Was it worth the effort? Lila says, "I'd do it again in a heartbeat!"
